## Where do I begin?
I have always had trouble keeping up with projects. Mostly becuase I get very into them and work hard on them for many hours.
After a couple days of this, however, I have to take a break and when I come back to it I have no idea where I was. 
I also tend to have way to many project going on at once that never get finished because who in their right mind actually finishes 
any program. 

Any I am hoping that by 'bloggin' (it sounds very hipster outloud) I can use this as a means to track changes to my projects I make
with code updates and with commentary so it will be easier to pick back up after a break. 

First step is to get a simple site going. Luckily I started this project a long time ago with GitHub.IO. Time to resurrect it. 
I also need some format, but I do not want to put more than 60 seconds into it. Keeps me from going down that rabbit hole of
"What's the best way of categorizing, sub-categorizing, taggings, future proofing, etc., etc., etc.".

So, format is (obvisously a WIP):

**Project:** github.io

**TODO:** 

  - Learn Markdown (yes, I know)
  - Publish page
  - Publish first post
  - Plan next post
  
**DID I?:** 

### Learn Markdown

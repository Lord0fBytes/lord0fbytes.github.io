title: First Blog Post on Github Pages!
---

This is my first post on Github pages. I need to start learning the markup language so this will look better. 

Hopefully this will be the start of a long journey to my eventual dream of being a part of an open source project.

Once I get a bit more time I will throw in some background and formatting. 

That's it for now.

Most of my work sits at the intersection of systems, people, and the day-to-day realities of keeping things running. My background has been in supporting and building systems that people depend on daily. This includes everything from core infrastructure and identity to end-user tooling and monitoring.

Over the years, I’ve worked across a wide range of operating systems and platforms, both legacy and current. That experience has shaped how I approach problems: understand the system, reduce unnecessary complexity, and fix the thing that actually causes the pain. I’m comfortable moving between hands-on technical work and higher-level coordination when teams or systems need it.

I’ve also spent time in team leadership roles, focusing on clear communication, accountability, and practical process. I've received training in EOS, Conscious Leadership, and formal management programs. This has reinforced that good teams are built through consistency and trust, not micromanagement or heroics.

Outside of work, I’ve been around computers since I was a kid and that early curiosity shaped how I think about technology today. I’m drawn to systems that are intentional, durable, and simple enough to disappear into the background.

I enjoy minimalism, reading, hockey (go Bruins), and spending time with my family. Most of my interests, work included, orbit around the same idea: fewer moving parts, clearer thinking, and things that hold up over time.

## Welcome to my corner of the internet. 
If you are reading this you were curious about my website and the stack that it runs on. My website was designed with [moonwalk](https://github.com/abhinavs/moonwalk) - a fast and minimalistic blog theme with clean dark mode. Check them out for more information about this theme. 

Are of the time of this writing I am running a humble Jekyll static site with the aforementioned theme on Github Pages. 

If there are any inaccurates on the website or things you would like to see feel free to raise a bug or feat here.

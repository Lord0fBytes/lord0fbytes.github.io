Here’s what I’m working on, learning, or exploring right now. I generally focus across three areas: outdoor, indoor, and digital projects. This is a living snapshot, updated as things evolve.

# FEB2026 - Damn it's cold out

This is what I’m focused on at the moment.

## Workshop organization

I’m cleaning out the detached garage and converting it into a woodworking shop. It’s part organization, part reset, part learning space. That and it is too cold out to do anything else outside.

## Chicken coop expansion - <mark>coming soon</mark>

I’m also expanding the chicken coop to improve the setup and give the flock more room. Slow, practical upgrades. More birds will be coming next month! 

## More storage for our small house

Finishing up a [basement storage project](/irl/finishing-basement-homeschool) — trying to make the house function better long term. We gutted out the understairs storage and rebuilt it with new shelves and some hidden doors.

## Year round hydroponics - <mark>coming soon</mark>

I will be starting an indoor hydroponics system to experiment with growing food year-round. Small scale for now, but I am excited to get into it.

## Digital Reset

Working through a broader [redesign of my digital life](/digital/personal-rebrand). I would like to have a consistent brand across all my social interactions. Updated LinkedIn, Bluesky, and this website.

## Downscaling homelab setup
Lastly, I’m [downscaling my homelab](/digital/homelab-scale-down): fewer physical servers, more VPSs and Docker containers. My previous setup with 6 server and a 42U rack was costing way to much for just a hobby. 

As usual check back monthly for new updates and progress.

Here’s what I’m working on, learning, or exploring right now. I generally focus across three areas: outdoor, indoor, and digital projects. This is a living snapshot, updated as things evolve.

### Outdoor Projects

Cleaning out the detached garage and transforming it into a woodworking shop.

Expanding the chicken coop and improving the outdoor setup for the flock.

### Indoor Projects

Finishing a base storage project to better organize the house.

Starting an indoor hydroponics system to experiment with growing food year-round.

### Digital Projects

Working on a life re-brand and redesign of my digital life.

Downscaling my homelab: moving from physical servers to VPSs and Docker containers.

As usual check back monthly for new updates and progress.
